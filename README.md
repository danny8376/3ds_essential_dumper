# 3ds_essential_dumper
Tiny program for dumping essential files from 3DS console, which hopefully works on
consoles that have dead FCRAM / NAND and broken screen.

## General Info
This program runs solely on ARM9 processor and only use ITCM/DTCM, thus should hopefully
works on consoles that have dead FCRAM (and maybe even VRAM/ARM9 Memory?)

It'll try to dump all these files whenever possible:
* OTP
* NAND CID
* NAND NCSD Header
* Embed GodMode9 Essential Backup
* If CTRNAND is mountable
  - HWCAL0/1
  - LocalFriendCodeSeed
  - SecureInfo
  - movable.sed
* Full NAND

Before dumping full NAND, it'll blink red power led (the same as low power indicator),
you can press Y/B to cancel it, or any other button to continue dumping.

## To-Do List / Roadmap
There're no space left in ITCM, so we need to somehow shrink things to be able to fit
anything more below :(
* setupKeyslots on init
  - seems to be required if booting directly from ntrboot?
* Proper title in log file

## How to Build This
Building requires [firmtool](https://github.com/TuxSH/firmtool), and either 
`arm-none-eabi-gcc` and `arm-none-eabi-objcopy` in path or DevkitARM installed.
Then, just run `make`.
